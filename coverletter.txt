Dear Hiring Manager,

I am Shrinath Deshpande, a Ph.D. Candidate at Stony Brook University with a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
I am writing to express my interest for the Intern position (Intern, Geometry & Knowledge Reconstruction).
I am working as a research assistant at Computer-Aided Design Innovation and Engineering Lab.

I have manifested my skills in the domains of Robotics, Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Computer Graphics, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Kinematics and Optimization through several projects and publications.

My Ph.D. research mainly focuses on developing a computational framework that can empower mechanical designers to innovate kinematic machines.  My motivation is to connect young engineers and mechanism synthesis methods through Artificial Intelligence.  I am working on building an ML assistant that assists young engineers by simplifying the user experience and giving them higher level control of the design process.

I am getting good results with the approach. I have authored a few publications alongside my thesis advisor Dr. Anurag Purwar.  My advisor and I have received A.T. Yang Memorial Award in Theoretical Kinematics, which is one of the most prestigious awards in our research community.

In general, I like to build things. I try to understand things in great depth and have the ability to size up a situation with precision and ease. I live in the world of possibilities and become excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties. When presented with a problem, I'm good at improvising and quickly come up with a creative solution.

I strongly feel that I am the right candidate for this position and will be thrilled to get the opportunity.

Please feel free to call me anytime at 631-633-1851 or send an email to deshpandeshrinath@gmail.com to arrange a meeting. I look forward to speaking with you!
