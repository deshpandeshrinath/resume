Dear Hiring Manager,

I am Shrinath Deshpande, a Ph.D. Candidate at Stony Brook University with the major in Mechanical Engineering and the minor in Computer Science.
I am writing (with the help of Grammarly) to express my interest for PhD Research Internship at Grammarly.
I am working as a research assistant at Computer-Aided Design Innovation and Engineering Lab.
I am currently looking for Internships and also for full-time opportunities after my graduation in December 2019.

My Ph.D. research mainly focuses on developing a computational framework that can empower mechanical designers to innovate kinematic machines.
My motivation is to connect young engineers and mechanism synthesis methods through Artificial Intelligence.
I am working on building an ML assistant that assists young engineers by simplifying the user experience and giving them higher level control of the design process.
In a way, the goal of my research is similar to Grammarly's vision, Empowering designers to express the problem without worrying about minor technicalities and focusing on the important aspects.

I have manifested my skills in the domains of Kinematics, Linear Algebra, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition and Optimization through several publications and projects.

I try to understand things in great depth and have the ability to size up a situation with precision and ease. I live in the world of possibilities and become excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties. When presented with a problem, I'm good at improvising and quickly come up with a creative solution.

I am the right candidate for this position and will be thrilled to get the opportunity.

Please feel free to call me anytime at 631-633-1851 or send an email to deshpandeshrinath@gmail.com to arrange a meeting. I look forward to speaking with you!
